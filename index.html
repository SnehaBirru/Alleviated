                  <h4><center>Around a year ago, we all became victims of the COVID-19 pandemic. The virus affected individuals all around the world mentally, physically, and emotionally. 
                    We ourselves saw our friends and familys' mental health drop significantly. We knew we had to help in any way possible.
                  We build this website so that people around the world could have someone to talk to, get advice from, and feel safe around. We hope that together,
                we can reduce rates of worry, stress, anxiety, and depression significantly, and make the world a happier place. </h4>
